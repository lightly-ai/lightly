class DINOLoss(Module):
    """Implementation of the loss described in 'Emerging Properties in
    Self-Supervised Vision Transformers'. [0]

    This implementation follows the code published by the authors. [1]
    It supports global and local image crops. A linear warmup schedule for the
    teacher temperature is implemented to stabilize training at the beginning.
    Centering is applied to the teacher output to avoid model collapse.

    Attributes:
        output_dim:
            Dimension of the model output.
        warmup_teacher_temp:
            Initial value of the teacher temperature. Should be decreased if the
            training loss does not decrease.
        teacher_temp:
            Final value of the teacher temperature after linear warmup. Values
            above 0.07 result in unstable behavior in most cases. Can be
            slightly increased to improve performance during fine-tuning.
        warmup_teacher_temp_epochs:
            Number of epochs for the teacher temperature warmup.
        student_temp:
            Temperature of the student.
        center_momentum:
            Momentum term for the center calculation.

    Examples:
        >>> # initialize loss function
        >>> loss_fn = DINOLoss(128)
        >>>
        >>> # generate a view of the images with a random transform
        >>> view = transform(images)
        >>>
        >>> # embed the view with a student and teacher model
        >>> teacher_out = teacher(view)
        >>> student_out = student(view)
        >>>
        >>> # calculate loss
        >>> loss = loss_fn([teacher_out], [student_out], epoch=0)
