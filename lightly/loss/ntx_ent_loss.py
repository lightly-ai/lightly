class NTXentLoss(MemoryBankModule):
    """Implementation of the Contrastive Cross Entropy Loss.

    This implementation follows the SimCLR[0] paper. If you enable the memory
    bank by setting the `memory_bank_size` value > 0 the loss behaves like 
    the one described in the MoCo[1] paper.

    [0] SimCLR, 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709
    [1] MoCo, 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722
    
    Attributes:
        temperature:
            Scale logits by the inverse of the temperature.
        memory_bank_size:
            Number of negative samples to store in the memory bank. 
            Use 0 for SimCLR. For MoCo we typically use numbers like 4096 or 65536.

    Raises:
        ValueError if abs(temperature) < 1e-8 to prevent divide by zero.

    Examples:

        >>> # initialize loss function without memory bank
        >>> loss_fn = NTXentLoss(memory_bank_size=0)
        >>>
        >>> # generate two random transforms of images
        >>> t0 = transforms(images)
        >>> t1 = transforms(images)
        >>>
        >>> # feed through SimCLR or MoCo model
        >>> batch = torch.cat((t0, t1), dim=0)
        >>> output = model(batch)
        >>>
        >>> # calculate loss
        >>> loss = loss_fn(output)
