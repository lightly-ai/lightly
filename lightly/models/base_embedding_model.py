        Extracts features with the backbone and applies the projection
        head and prediction head(s) to the output space. If both x0 and x1
        are not None, both will be passed through the
        backbone, projection, and prediction head. If x1 is None, only x0
        will be forwarded.

        Args:
            x0:
                Tensor of shape bsz x channels x W x H.
            x1:

            return_features:
                Whether or not to return the intermediate features backbone(x).

        Returns:
            The output prediction and projection of x0 and (if x1 is not None)
            the output prediction and projection of x1. If return_features is
            True, the output for each x is a tuple (out, f) where f are the
            features before the projection head.

        Examples:

            >>> out = model(x) 
            >>> 
            >>> # single input with return_features=True
