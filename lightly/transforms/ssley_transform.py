class SSLEYTransform(MultiViewTransform):
    """Implements the transformations for SSL-EY.

    Input to this transform:
        PIL Image or Tensor.

    Output of this transform:
        List of Tensor of length 2.

    Applies the following augmentations by default:
        - Random resized crop
        - Random horizontal flip
        - Color jitter
        - Random gray scale
        - Random solarization
        - Gaussian blur
        - ImageNet normalization

    Similar to SimCLR transform but with extra solarization.

    Attributes:
        input_size:
            Size of the input image in pixels.
        cj_prob:
            Probability that color jitter is applied.
        cj_strength:
            Strength of the color jitter. `cj_bright`, `cj_contrast`, `cj_sat`, and
            `cj_hue` are multiplied by this value.
        cj_bright:
            How much to jitter brightness.
        cj_contrast:
            How much to jitter constrast.
        cj_sat:
            How much to jitter saturation.
        cj_hue:
            How much to jitter hue.
        min_scale:
            Minimum size of the randomized crop relative to the input_size.
        random_gray_scale:
            Probability of conversion to grayscale.
        solarize_prob:
            Probability of solarization.
        gaussian_blur:
            Probability of Gaussian blur.
        kernel_size:
            Will be deprecated in favor of `sigmas` argument. If set, the old behavior applies and `sigmas` is ignored.
            Used to calculate sigma of gaussian blur with kernel_size * input_size.
        sigmas:
            Tuple of min and max value from which the std of the gaussian kernel is sampled.
            Is ignored if `kernel_size` is set.
        vf_prob:
            Probability that vertical flip is applied.
        hf_prob:
            Probability that horizontal flip is applied.
        rr_prob:
            Probability that random rotation is applied.
        rr_degrees:
            Range of degrees to select from for random rotation. If rr_degrees is None,
            images are rotated by 90 degrees. If rr_degrees is a (min, max) tuple,
            images are rotated by a random angle in [min, max]. If rr_degrees is a
            single number, images are rotated by a random angle in
            [-rr_degrees, +rr_degrees]. All rotations are counter-clockwise.
        normalize:
            Dictionary with 'mean' and 'std' for torchvision.transforms.Normalize.
