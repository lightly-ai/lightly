        """Turns a batch of tuples into single tuple.

        Args:
            batch:
                The input batch. It is a list of (views, label, filename) tuples for each file in the dataset.
                In particular, views is the output of the augmentation, so it is a list of tensors with n views.
                For example:
                [
                    ([image_0_view_0, image_0_view_1, ...], label_0, filename_0),
                    ([image_1_view_0, image_1_view_1, ...], label_1, filename_1),
                    ...
                ]

        Returns:
            A tuple containing lists of images, labels and filenames.
            Structure example:
            (
                [
                    Tensor([image_0_view_0, image_1_view_0]),
                    Tensor([image_0_view_1, image_1_view_1]),
                    ...
                ],
                [label_0, label_1, ...],
                [filename_0, filename_1, ...]
            )
