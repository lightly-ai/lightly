    Attributes:
        api_workflow_client:
            The client to connect to the api.
        query_set:
            Set of filenames corresponding to samples which can possibly be selected.
            Set to all samples in the query tag or to the whole dataset by default.
        labeled_set:
            Set of filenames corresponding to samples in the labeled set.
            Set to all samples in the preselected tag or to an empty list by default.
        unlabeled_set:
            Set of filenames corresponding to samples which are in the query set
            but not in the labeled set.
        added_set:
            Set of filenames corresponding to samples which were added to the 
            labeled set in the last query.

    Examples:
        >>> # set the token and dataset id
