""" Lightly is a computer vision framework for self-supervised learning.

With Lightly you can train deep learning models using
self-supervision. This means, that you don't require
any labels to train a model. Lightly has been built
to help you understand and work with large unlabeled datasets.
It is built on top of PyTorch and therefore fully compatible 
with other frameworks such as Fast.ai.

For information about the command-line interace, see lightly.cli.
