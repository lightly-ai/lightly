# Examples

We provide example implementations for self-supervised learning models for PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning to give you a headstart when implementing your own model! 


All examples can be run from the terminal with:

```
python <path to example.py>
```

The examples should also run on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). Remember to activate the GPU otherwise training will be very slow! You can simply copy paste the code and add the following line at the beginning of the notebook to install lightly:

```
!pip install lightly

# add code from example below
```


You can find additional information for each model in our [Documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai//examples/models.html#)
