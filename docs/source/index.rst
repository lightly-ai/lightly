Documentation
===================================

Lightly is a computer vision framework for self-supervised learning.

With Lightly you can train deep learning models using self-supervision. 
This means, that you donâ€™t require any labels to train a model. 
Lightly has been built to help you understand and work with large unlabeled 
datasets. It is built on top of PyTorch and therefore fully compatible with 
other frameworks such as Fast.ai.

**NEW** Lightly now has integrated support for active learning in combination 
with the Lightly platform. Use the open-source framework to create embeddings 
of your unlabeled data and combine them with model predictions to select 
the most valuable samples for labeling.
