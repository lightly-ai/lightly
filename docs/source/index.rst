Documentation
===================================

.. note:: These pages document the Lightly self-supervised learning library.
          If you are looking for the Lightly Worker Solution with
          advanced `active learning algorithms <https://docs.lightly.ai/docs/selection>`_ and
          `selection strategies <https://docs.lightly.ai/docs/selection>`_ to select the best samples
          within millions of unlabeled images or video frames stored in your cloud storage or locally,
          please follow our `Lightly Worker documentation <https://docs.lightly.ai/>`_.

Lightly SSL is a computer vision framework for self-supervised learning.

With Lightly SSL you can train deep learning models using self-supervision. 
This means, that you donâ€™t require any labels to train a model. 
Lightly SSL has been built to help you understand and work with large unlabeled 
datasets. It is built on top of PyTorch and therefore fully compatible with 
other frameworks such as Fast.ai.
