Documentation
===================================

.. seealso:: 
   
   These pages document the Lightly self-supervised learning research library. If you
   are instead looking to leverage SSL and distillation pretrain with only a few lines of code
   head over to `LightlyTrain <https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/index.html>`_ instead. And if you are looking for the Lightly\ **One** Worker Solution with
   advanced `active learning algorithms <https://docs.lightly.ai/docs/customize-a-selection>`_ and
   `selection strategies <https://docs.lightly.ai/docs/selection-examples-and-use-cases>`_ to select the best samples
   within millions of unlabeled images or video frames stored in your cloud storage or locally,
   please follow our Lightly\ **One** Worker `documentation <https://docs.lightly.ai/>`_.


Lightly\ **SSL** is a computer vision framework for self-supervised learning.

With Lightly\ **SSL** you can train deep learning models using self-supervision. 
This means, that you donâ€™t require any labels to train a model. 
Lightly\ **SSL** has been built to help you understand and work with large unlabeled 
datasets. It is built on top of PyTorch and therefore fully compatible with 
other frameworks such as Fast.ai.

For a commercial version with more features, including Docker support and pretraining
models for embedding, classification, detection, and segmentation tasks with
a single command, please contact sales@lightly.ai.
