Platform
===================================

Lightly is more than just a framework for self-supervised learning. We built a complete data curation platform on top.
Use the embeddings generated using the lightly framework and use them to curate your dataset. Collaborate with your friends
and share the curated data with your favorite data labeling partner.

In this tutorial series, you will learn how to get the most out of the platform.
