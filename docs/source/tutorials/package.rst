===================================

With the lightly framework you can use the power of self-supervised learning
for computervision with ease. Here we show you tutorials to help you work with

Since lightly is built on top of `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/tutorials/>`_ 
and `PyTorch Lightning <https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning>`_ 
you might want to have a look at the two frameworks to understand basic concepts.
