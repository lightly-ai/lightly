Active learning
===================
Lightly enables active learning with only a few lines of additional code. Learn 
here, how to get the most out of your data by maximizing the available information
in your annotated dataset.

Preparations
-----------------
Before you read on, make sure you have read the section on the :ref:`lightly-platform`. 
In particular, you should know how to create a dataset in the `web-app <https://app.lightly.ai>`_.
and how to upload images and embeddings to it. To do active learning, you will 
need such a dataset with embeddings (don't worry, it's free!).


Concepts
-----------------
Lightly makes use of the following concepts for active learning:

* **ApiWorkflowClient:** :py:class:`lightly.api.api_workflow_client.ApiWorkflowClient`
   The `ApiWorkflowClient` is used to connect to our API. The API handles the 
   selection of the images based on embeddings and active learning scores. To initialize
   the `ApiWorkflowClient`, you will need the `datasetId` and the `token` from the 
   :ref:`lightly-platform`.
   
* **ActiveLearningAgent:** :py:class:`lightly.active_learning.agents.agent.ActiveLearningAgent`
   The `ActiveLearningAgent` builds the client interface of our active learning 
   framework. It allows to indicate which images are preselected and which ones
   to sample from. Furthermore, one can query it to get a new batch of images.
   To initialize an `ActiveLearningAgent` you need an `ApiWorkflowClient`.
   
* **SamplerConfig:** :py:class:`lightly.active_learning.config.sampler_config.SamplerConfig`
   The `SamplerConfig` allows the configuration of a sampling request. In particular,
   you can set number of samples, the name of the resulting selection, and the `SamplingMethod`.
   Currently, you can set the `SamplingMethod` to one of the following:

   * Random: Selects samples uniformly at random.
   * Coreset: Greedily selects samples which are diverse.
   * Coral: Combines Coreset with scores to do active learning.
   
* **Scorer:** :py:class:`lightly.active_learning.scorers.scorer.Scorer`
   The `Scorer` takes as input the predictions of a pre-trained model on the set
   of unlabeled images. It evaluates different scores based on how certain the model
   is about the images and passes them to the API so the sampler can use them with
   Coral.
   

Continue reading to see how these components interact and how active learning is
done with Lightly.


Initial Selection
-----------------
The goal of making an initial selection is to get a subdataset on which you can train
an initial model. The output of the model can then be used to select new samples. That way,
the model can be iteratively improved.

To make an initial selection, start off by adding your raw, *unlabeled* data and the according
image embeddings to a dataset in the Lightly `web-app <https://app.lightly.ai>`_. A simple way to do so
is to use `lightly-magic` from the command-line. Don't forget adapt the arguments input_dir,
dataset_id and token.

.. code-block:: bash

   # use trainer.max_epochs=0 to skip training
   lightly-magic input_dir='path/to/your/raw/dataset' dataset_id='xyz' token='123' trainer.max_epochs=0

Next, you will need to initialize the `ApiWorkflowClient` and the `ActiveLearningAgent`

.. code-block:: Python

    import lightly
    from lightly.api import ApiWorkflowClient
    from lightly.active_learning.agents import ActiveLearningAgent

    api_client = ApiWorkflowClient(dataset_id='xyz', token='123')
    al_agent = ActiveLearningAgent(api_client) 


.. note::

   It may not always be a good idea to sample from the full dataset. For example,
   it could be that a large portion of the images is blurry. In that case, it's 
   possible to create a tag in the web-app which only contains the sharp images
   and tell the `ActiveLearningAgent` to only sample from this tag. To do so, set
   the `query_tag_name` argument in the constructor.

Let's configure the sampling request and request an initial selection next:

.. code-block:: Python

   from lightly.active_learning.config import SamplerConfig
   from lightly.openapi_generated.swagger_client import SamplingMethod

   # we want an initial pool of 100 images
   config = SamplerConfig(n_samples=100, method=SamplingMethod.CORESET, name='initial-selection')
   initial_selection = al_agent.query(sampler_config)
   
   # initial_selection contains now 100 filenames

The query returns the list of filenames corresponding to the initial selection. Additionally, you
will find that a tag has been created in the web-app under the name "initial-selection".
Head there to scroll through the samples and download the selected images before annotating them.


Active Learning Step
----------------------

After you have annotated your initial selection of images, you can train a model
on them. The trained model can then be used to figure out, with which images it 
has problems. These images can then be added to the labeled dataset.

To continue with active learning with Lightly, you will need the `ApiWorkflowClient` and `ActiveLearningAgent` from before.
If you perform the next selection step in a new file you have to initialize the client and agent again.
If you have to re-initialize them, make sure to set the `pre_selected_tag_name` to your
current selection (if this is the first iteration, this is the name you have passed 
to the sampler config when doing the initial selection). Note, that if you don't 
have to re-initialize them, the tracking of the tags is taken care of for you.

.. code-block:: Python

   # re-initializing the ApiWorkflowClient and ActiveLearningAgent
   api_client = ApiWorkflowClient(dataset_id='xyz', token='123')
   al_agent = ActiveLearningAgent(api_client, preselected_tag_name='initial-selection')

The next part is what differentiates active learning from simple subsampling; the
trained model is used to get predictions on the unlabeled data and the sampler then
decides based on these predictions. To get a list of all filenames in the unlabeled set,
you can simply call

.. code-block:: Python

   # get all filenames in the unlabeled set
   unlabeled_set = al_agent.unlabeled_set

Use this list to get predictions on the unlabeled images.

**Important:** The predictions need to be in the same order as the filenames in the
list returned by the `ActiveLearningAgent` and they need to be stored in a numpy array.

Once you have the scores in the right order, make sure to normalize them such that
the rows sum to one. Then, create a scorer object like so:


.. code-block:: Python

    from lightly.active_learning.scorers import ScorerClassification

    scorer = ScorerClassification(predictions)

Now you have everything to get the next batch of images. One important thing to mention
here is that the argument `n_samples` always refers to the total size of the labeled set.

.. code-block:: Python

   # we want a total of 200 images after the first iteration
   # this time, we use the CORAL sampler and provide a scorer to the query
   config = SamplerConfig(n_samples=200, method=SamplingMethod.CORAL, name='al-iteration-1')
   labeled_set_iteration_1 = al_agent.query(sampler_config, scorer)

   assert len(labeled_set_iteration_1) == 200

As before, you will receive the filenames of all the images in the labeled set and there
will be a new tag named `al-iteration-1` visible in the web-app. You can repeat the active
learning step until the model achieves the required accuracy.

Scorers
-----------------
Lightly has so called scorers for the common computer vision tasks such as 
image classification, detection and others. Depending on the task your working
on you can use a different scorer.

Image Classification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Use this scorer when working on a classification problem (binary or multiclass).
