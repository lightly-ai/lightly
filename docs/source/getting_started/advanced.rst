Advanced
===================

In this section, we will have a look at some more advanced topics around lightly. 
For the moment lightly focuses mostly on contrastive learning methods. 
In contrastive learning, we create multiple views of each sample and during 
the training of the model force similar views (originating from the 
same sample) to be close to each other respective different views 
(originating from different samples to be far away. Views are typically 
obtained using augmentation methods.

Through this procedure, we train invariances towards certain augmentations 
when training models using contrastive learning methods. 

Different augmentations result in different invariances. The invariances you 
want to learn heavily depend on the type of downstream task you want to solve. 
Here, we group the augmentations by the type of invariance they induce and 
show examples of when such invariances can be useful.

**Shape Invariances**

- **Random cropping** E.g. We don't care if an object is small or large 
  or only partially in the image

- **Random Horizontal Flip** E.g. We don't care about "left and right" in 
  images.

- **Random Vertical Flip** E.g. We don't care about "up and down" in images.
  This can be useful for satellite images.

- **Random Rotation** E.g. We don't care about the orientation of the camera.
  This can be useful for satellite images.


**Texture Invariances**

- **Gaussian Blur** E.g. We don't care about the details of a person but the
  overall shape.


**Color Invariances**

- **Color Jittering** E.g. We don't care if a car is blue or red

- **Random Grayscale** E.g. We don't care about the color of a tree

Some interesting papers regarding invariances in self-supervised learning:

- `Demystifying Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning, S. Purushwalkam, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13916>`_
- `What Should Not Be Contrastive in Contrastive Learning, T. Xiao, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05659>`_


.. note:: Picking the right augmentation method seems crucial for the outcome
          of training models using contrastive learning. For example, if we want
          to create a model classifying cats by color we should not use strong
          color augmentations such as color jittering or random grayscale.


Augmentations
-------------------

Lightly uses the collate operation to apply augmentations when loading a batch 
of samples using the 
`PyTorch dataloader <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html>`_.

The built-in collate class  
:py:class:`lightly.data.collate.ImageCollateFunction` provides a set of 
common augmentations used in SimCLR and MoCo. Instead of a single batch of images,
it returns a tuple of two batches of randomly transformed images.

Since Gaussian blur and random rotations by 90 degrees are not supported
by default in torchvision, we added them to lightly 
:py:class:`lightly.transforms`

You can build your own collate function by inheriting from 
:py:class:`lightly.data.collate.BaseCollateFunction`

.. code-block:: python

  # create a dataset using SimCLR augmentations
  collate_fn = lightly.data.SimCLRCollateFunction()
  dataloader_train_simclr = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    dataset_train_simclr, 
    collate_fn=collate_fn,
  )
  
  # same augmentation but without blur and resize images to 128x128
  collate_fn = lightly.data.SimCLRCollateFunction(
    input_size=128,
    gaussian_blur=0.
  )
  dataloader_train_simclr = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
    dataset_train_simclr, 
    collate_fn=collate_fn,
  )



Models
-------------------

Lightly supports at the moment the following two models for self-supervised
learning:

- `SimCLR: A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations, T. Chen, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709>`_
  
  - Check the documentation: :py:class:`lightly.models.simclr.SimCLR`

- `MoCo: Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning, K. He, 2019 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722>`_
  
  - Check the documentation: :py:class:`lightly.models.moco.MoCo`

- `SimSiam: Exploring Simple Siamese Representation Learning, K. He, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566>`_

  - Check the documentation: :py:class:`lightly.models.simsiam.SimSiam`

Do you know a model that should be on this list? Please add an issue on GitHub :)

All models have a backbone component. This could be a ResNet.
When creating a self-supervised learning model you pass it a backbone. You need
to make sure the backbone output dimension matches the `num_ftrs` parameter 
of the model.

.. code-block:: python

        # create a ResNet backbone and remove the classification head
        resnet = lightly.models.ResNetGenerator('resnet-18')
        backbone = nn.Sequential(
            *list(resnet.children())[:-1],
            nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1),
        )

        # create a simclr model based on ResNet
        self.resnet_simclr = lightly.models.SimCLR(backbone, num_ftrs=512)


Losses 
-------------------

We provide the most common loss function for contrastive learning and a symmetric negative cosine similarity 
loss for non-contrastive methods.

- `NTXentLoss: Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy Loss <https://paperswithcode.com/method/nt-xent>`_

  - Check the documentation: :py:class:`lightly.loss.ntx_ent_loss.NTXentLoss`
  - This loss can be combined with a :ref:`lightly-advanced-memory-bank` 

- `Symmetric Negative Cosine Similarity Loss <https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10566>`_

  - Check the documentation: :py:class:`lightly.loss.sym_neg_cos_sim_loss.SymNegCosineSimilarityLoss`


.. _lightly-advanced-memory-bank:

Memory Bank
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since contrastive learning methods benefit from many negative examples, larger
batch sizes are preferred. However, not everyone has a multi GPU cluster at 
hand. Therefore, alternative tricks and methods have been derived in research.
One of them is a memory bank keeping past examples as additional negatives.

For an example of the memory bank in action have a look at 
:ref:`lightly-moco-tutorial-2`. 

For more information check the documentation: 
:py:class:`lightly.loss.memory_bank.MemoryBankModule`.

.. code-block:: python

  # to create a NTXentLoss with a memory bank (like for MoCo) set the 
  # memory_bank_size parameter to a value > 0
  criterion = lightly.loss.NTXentLoss(memory_bank_size=4096)
  # the memory bank is used automatically for every forward pass
  y0, y1 = resnet_moco(x0, x1)
  loss = criterion(y0, y1)

  # you can also use a symmetric loss instead (for faster convergence)
  y0_a, y1_a = resnet_moco(x0, x1)
  y0_b, y1_b = resnet_moco(x1, x0)
  loss = 0.5 * (criterion(y0_a, y1_a) + criterion(y0_b, y1_b))



Extracting specific Video Frames
--------------------------------

When working with videos, it is preferred not to have to extract all 
the frames beforehand. With lightly we can not only subsample the video 
to find interesting frames for annotation but also extract only these frames.

Let's have a look at how this works:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    import lightly

    # read the list of filenames (e.g. from the Lightly Docker output)
    with open('sampled_filenames.txt', 'r') as f:
        filenames = [line.rstrip() for line in f]

    # let's have a look at the first 5 filenames
    print(filenames[:5])
    # >>> '068536-mp4.png'
    # >>> '138032-mp4.png'
    # >>> '151774-mp4.png'
    # >>> '074234-mp4.png'
    # >>> '264863-mp4.png'

    path_to_video_data = 'video/'
    dataset = lightly.data.LightlyDataset(from_folder=path_to_video_data)

    # let's get the total number of frames
    print(len(dataset))
    # >>> 341965

    # Now we have to extract the frame number from the filename.
    # Since the length of the filename should always be the same,
    # we can extract the substring simply using indexing.

    # we can experiment until we find the right match
    print(filenames[0][-14:-8])
    # >>> '068536'

    # let's get all the substrings
    frame_numbers = [fname[-14:-8] for fname in filenames]

    # let's check whether the first 5 frame numbers make sense
    print(frame_numbers[:5])
    # >>> ['068536', '138032', '151774', '074234', '264863']

    # now we convert the strings into integers so we can use them for indexing
    frame_numbers = [int(frame_number) for frame_number in frame_numbers]

    # let's get the first frame number
    img, label, fname = dataset[frame_numbers[0]]

    # a quick sanity check
    # fname should again be the filename from our list
    print(fname == filenames[0])
    # >>> True

    # before saving the images make sure an output folder exists
    out_dir = 'save_here_my_images'
    if not os.path.exists(out_dir):
        os.mkdir(out_dir)

    # let's get all the frames and dump them into a new folder
    for frame_number in frame_numbers:
        img, label, fname = dataset[frame_number]
        dst_fname = os.path.join(out_dir, fname)
        img.save(dst_fname)


    # want to save the images as jpgs instead of pngs?
    # we can simply replace the file engine .png with .jpg

    #for frame_number in frame_numbers:
    #    img, label, fname = dataset[frame_number]
    #    dst_fname = os.path.join(out_dir, fname)
    #    dst_fname = dst_fname.replace('.png', '.jpg')
    #    img.save(dst_fname)

The example has been tested on a system running Python 3.7 and lightly 1.0.6
