Advanced Concepts in Self-Supervised Learning
=============================================

In this section, we will have a look at some more advanced topics around Lightly SSL.

Augmentations
-------------

Most recent self-supervised learning methods create multiple views of each image during
training and learn that embeddings of views from the same image should be as similar as
possible. As these views are typically created using augmentations, the model learns to
be *invariant* to certain augmentations.

Different augmentations result in different invariances. The invariances you 
want to learn heavily depend on the type of downstream task you want to solve. 
Here, we group the augmentations by the type of invariance they induce and 
show examples of when such invariances can be useful.

For example, if we use `color jittering` and `random grayscale` during the training of a
self-supervised model, we train the model to put the two augmented versions of the 
input image very close to each other in the feature space. We essentially train 
the model to ignore the color augmentations.

**Shape Invariances**

- **Random cropping** E.g. We don't care if an object is small or large 
  or only partially in the image.

- **Random Horizontal Flip** E.g. We don't care about "left and right" in 
  images.

- **Random Vertical Flip** E.g. We don't care about "up and down" in images.
  This can be useful for satellite images.

- **Random Rotation** E.g. We don't care about the orientation of the camera.
  This can be useful for satellite images.


**Texture Invariances**

- **Gaussian Blur** E.g. We don't care about the details of a person but the
  overall shape.


**Color Invariances**

- **Color Jittering** E.g. We don't care if a car is blue or red

- **Random Grayscale** E.g. We don't care about the color of a tree

- **Solarization** E.g. We don't care about color and brightness

Some interesting papers regarding invariances in self-supervised learning:

- `Demystifying Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning, S. Purushwalkam, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13916>`_
- `What Should Not Be Contrastive in Contrastive Learning, T. Xiao, 2020 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05659>`_


.. note:: Picking the right augmentation method seems crucial for the outcome
          of training models using contrastive learning. For example, if we want
          to create a model classifying cats by color we should not use strong
          color augmentations such as color jittering or random grayscale.

.. note:: Recently, masked image modeling (MIM) has become a popular method
          for self-supervised learning. MIM is a different approach as the goal is not
          to map different views of the same image close to each other in the feature
          space. Instead, the model learns to predict the masked parts of the image.
          This has the advantage that the model doesn't learn an invariance with respect
          to the augmentations. Popular MIM methods are :ref:`mae` and :ref:`simmim`.
          For a more in-depth discussion of different self-supervised learning methods
          see `A Cookbook of Self-Supervised Learning <https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12210>`_.


Transforms
^^^^^^^^^^

Lightly SSL uses `Torchvision transforms <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html>`_
to apply augmentations to images. The Lightly SSL :py:mod:`~lightly.transforms` module
exposes transforms for common self-supervised learning methods.

The most important difference compared to transforms for other tasks, such as
classification, object detection, or segmentation, is that self-supervised learning
requires multiple views per image. For example, :ref:`simclr` uses two views per image
while :ref:`dino` uses two global and multiple, smaller local views per image.

.. note:: If you use the :ref:`lightly-command-line-tool` you have access to all SimCLR
  augmentations. You find the default parameters here: :ref:`ref-cli-config-default`. 

.. note:: Since **solarization** and **random rotations** by 90 degrees are not supported
  in Torchvision, we added them to the :py:mod:`~lightly.transforms` module as well.


Custom Transforms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are three ways how you can customize augmentations in Lightly SSL:

1. Modify the parameters of the :py:mod:`~lightly.transforms` provided by Lightly SSL:
  
  .. code-block:: python

    from lightly.transforms import SimCLRTransform

    transform = SimCLRTransform(
        input_size=128,   # resize input images to 128x128 pixels
        cj_prob=0.0,      # disable color jittering
        rr_prob=0.5,      # apply random rotation by 90 degrees with 50% probability
    )

  .. note:: You can disable the augmentations by either setting the probability to `0.0`
    or making sure the augmentation has no effect. For example, random cropping 
    can be disabled by setting `min_scale=1.0`.

2. Create a new transform by combining multiple transforms into a :py:class:`~lightly.transforms.multi_view_transform.MultiViewTransform`:

  .. code-block:: python

    from torchvision import transforms as T
    from lightly.transforms.multi_view_transform import MultiViewTransform

    # Create a global view transform that crops 224x224 patches from the input image.
    global_view = T.Compose([
        T.RandomResizedCrop(size=224, scale=(0.08, 1.0)),
        T.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        T.RandomGrayscale(p=0.5),
        T.ToTensor(),
    ])

    # Create a local view transform that crops a random portion of the input image and resizes it to a 96x96 patch.
    local_view = T.Compose([
        T.RandomResizedCrop(size=96, scale=(0.05, 0.4)),
        T.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        T.RandomGrayscale(p=0.5),
        T.ToTensor(),
    ])

    # Combine the transforms. Every transform will create one view.
    # The final transform will create four views: two global and two local views.
    transform = MultiViewTransform([global_view, global_view, local_view, local_view])
    views = transform(image)

3. Write a completely new `Torchvision transform <https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html>`_.
   One of the benefits of Lightly is that it doesn't restrict you to a specific framework.
   If you need a special transform then you can write it yourself. Just make sure to
   adapt your training loop if required:

  .. code:: python

    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

    class MyTransform:
        def __call__(self, image):
            # Overwrite this method and apply custom augmentations to your image.

    transform = MyTransform(...)
    dataset = LightlyDataset(..., transform=transform)
    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, ...)
    for batch in dataloader:
        views = ... # get views from the batch, this depends on your transform



Previewing Augmentations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::
  This section is outdated and still uses the old collate functions which are deprecated
  since v1.4.0. We will update this section soon.

It often can be very useful to understand how the image augmentations we pick affect
the input dataset. We provide a few helper methods that make it very easy to 
preview augmentations using Lightly SSL.

.. literalinclude:: code_examples/plot_image_augmentations.py

You can run the code in a Jupyter Notebook to quickly explore the augmentations.
Once you run `plot_augmented_images` you should see the original images as 
well as their augmentations next to them.

.. figure:: images/simclr_augmentations.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: SimCLR augmentations example

    Example augmentations of the `SimCLRCollateFunction` function on images
    from the clothing dataset.

The images seem rather blurry! However, we don't want our model to ignore small
details. Let's disable Gaussian Blur and check again:


.. figure:: images/simclr_augmentations_no_blur.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: SimCLR augmentations example

    Example augmentations of the `SimCLRCollateFunction` function on images
    from the clothing dataset.

We can also repeat the experiment for the `DINOCollateFunction` to see what 
our DINO model would see during training.

.. figure:: images/dino_augmentations.jpg
    :align: center
    :alt: DINO augmentations example

    Example augmentations of the `DINOCollateFunction` function on images
    from the clothing dataset.



Models
------

See the :ref:`models` section for a list of models that are available in Lightly SSL.

Do you know a model that should be on this list? Please add an `issue <https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly/issues>`_
on GitHub :)

All models have a backbone component. This could be a ResNet, Vision Transformer, or any
other vision model. When creating a self-supervised learning model you pass it a
backbone. You need to make sure the backbone output dimension matches the input
dimension of the head component for the respective self-supervised model.

Lightly SSL has a built-in generator for ResNets. However, the model architecture slightly
differs from the official ResNet implementation. The difference is in the first few
layers. Whereas the official ResNet starts with a 7x7 convolution the one from Lightly SSL
has a 3x3 convolution. 

* The 3x3 convolution variant is more efficient (fewer parameters and faster 
  processing) and is better suited for small input images (32x32 pixels or 64x64 pixels). 
  We recommend using the Lightly SSL variant for cifar10 or running the model on a microcontroller 
  (see https://github.com/ARM-software/EndpointAI/tree/master/ProofOfConcepts/Vision/OpenMvMaskDefaults)
* However, the 7x7 convolution variant is better suited for larger images 
  since the number of features is smaller due to the stride and additional 
  `MaxPool2d` layer. For benchmarking against other academic papers on 
  datasets such as ImageNet, Pascal VOC, MOCO, etc. use the Torchvision variant.


.. code-block:: python

  from torch import nn

  # Create a Lightly SSL ResNet.
  from lightly.models import ResNetGenerator
  resnet = ResNetGenerator('resnet-18')
  # Ignore the classification layer as we want the features as output.
  resnet.linear = nn.Identity()

  # Alternatively create a Torchvision ResNet backbone.
  import torchvision
  resnet_torchvision = torchvision.models.resnet18()
  # Ignore the classification layer as we want the features as output.
  resnet_torchvision.fc = nn.Identity()

  # Create a SimCLR model based on ResNet.
  class SimCLR(torch.nn.Module):
      def __init__(self, backbone, hidden_dim, out_dim):
          super().__init__()
          self.backbone = backbone
          self.projection_head = SimCLRProjectionHead(hidden_dim, hidden_dim, out_dim)

      def forward(self, x):
          h = self.backbone(x).flatten(start_dim=1)
          z = self.projection_head(h)
          return z

  resnet_simclr = SimCLR(backbone, hidden_dim=512, out_dim=128)

You can also use **custom backbones** with Lightly SSL. We provide a 
`colab notebook to show how you can use torchvision or timm models
<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ubepXnpANiWOSmq80e-mqAxjLx53m-zu?usp=sharing>`_.


Losses
------

We provide the most common loss functions for self-supervised learning in the
:py:mod:`~lightly.loss` module.


.. _lightly-advanced-memory-bank:

Memory Bank
^^^^^^^^^^^

Since contrastive learning methods benefit from many negative examples, larger
batch sizes are preferred. However, not everyone has a multi GPU cluster at 
hand. Therefore, alternative tricks and methods have been derived in research.
One of them is a memory bank keeping past examples as additional negatives.

For an example of the memory bank in action have a look at 
:ref:`lightly-moco-tutorial-2`. 

For more information check the documentation: 
:py:class:`lightly.loss.memory_bank.MemoryBankModule`.

.. code-block:: python

  # to create a NTXentLoss with a memory bank (like for MoCo) set the 
  # memory_bank_size parameter to a value > 0
  from lightly.loss import NTXentLoss
  criterion = NTXentLoss(memory_bank_size=4096)
  # the memory bank is used automatically for every forward pass
  y0, y1 = resnet_moco(x0, x1)
  loss = criterion(y0, y1)


Obtaining Good Embeddings
---------------------------

We optimize the workflow of selecting only important datapoints by using **low-dimensional embeddings**.
This has two benefits:

- Low-dimensional embeddings have more meaningful distance metrics. 
  We know that the data usually lies on a manifold in high-dimensional spaces 
  (see `curse of dimensionality <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality>`_). 
  Even very similar samples might have a high L2-distance or low cosine similarity in high embeddings.
- Most algorithms to select a subset based on the embeddings scale with
  the dimensionality. Therefore low-dimensional embeddings can significantly 
  reduce computing time.

We leverage **self-supervised learning** to obtain good 
features/representations/embedddings of your unlabeled data. The quality of the 
representations depends heavily on the chosen augmentations. For example, 
imagine you want to train a classifier to detect healthy and unhealthy leaves. 
Training self-supervised models with color augmentation enabled would make the 
model and therefore the embeddings invariant towards different colors. However, 
the color might be a very important feature of the leave to determine whether 
it is healthy (green) or not (brown).

Monitoring Embedding Quality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide several tools to assess the embedding quality during model training.
The :class:`Benchmark Module <lightly.utils.benchmarking.BenchmarkModule>` runs
a KNN benchmark on a validation set after every training epoch. Measuring KNN
accuracy during training is an efficient way to monitor model training and does
not require expensive fine-tuning.

We also provide a helper function to monitor representation collapse. 
Representation collapse can happen during unstable training and results in the 
model predicting the same, or very similar, representations for all images. 
This is of course disastrous for model training as we want to the 
representations to be as different as possible between images!
The :func:`std_of_l2_normalized <lightly.utils.debug.std_of_l2_normalized>` 
helper function can be used on any representations as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  from lightly.utils.debug import std_of_l2_normalized
  representations = model(images)
  std_of_l2_normalized(representations)

A value close to 0 indicates that the representations have collapsed. A value
close to `1/sqrt(dimensions)`, where `dimensions` are the number of representation
dimensions, indicates that the representations are stable. Below we show model
training outputs from a run where the representations collapse and one where
they don't collapse.

.. code-block::

  # run with collapse
  epoch: 00, loss: -0.78153, representation std: 0.02611
  epoch: 01, loss: -0.96428, representation std: 0.02477
  epoch: 02, loss: -0.97460, representation std: 0.01636
  epoch: 03, loss: -0.97894, representation std: 0.01936
  epoch: 04, loss: -0.97770, representation std: 0.01565
  epoch: 05, loss: -0.98308, representation std: 0.01192
  epoch: 06, loss: -0.98641, representation std: 0.01133
  epoch: 07, loss: -0.98673, representation std: 0.01583
  epoch: 08, loss: -0.98708, representation std: 0.01146
  epoch: 09, loss: -0.98654, representation std: 0.01656

  # run without collapse
  epoch: 00, loss: -0.35693, representation std: 0.06708
  epoch: 01, loss: -0.69948, representation std: 0.05853
  epoch: 02, loss: -0.74144, representation std: 0.05710
  epoch: 03, loss: -0.74297, representation std: 0.05804
  epoch: 04, loss: -0.71997, representation std: 0.06441
  epoch: 05, loss: -0.70027, representation std: 0.06738
  epoch: 06, loss: -0.70543, representation std: 0.06898
  epoch: 07, loss: -0.71539, representation std: 0.06875
  epoch: 08, loss: -0.72629, representation std: 0.06991
  epoch: 09, loss: -0.72912, representation std: 0.06945

We note that in both runs the loss decreases, indicating that the model is
making progress. The representation std shows, however, that the two runs are
very different. The std in the first run decreases towards zero which means that
the representations become more and more similar. The std in the second run
remains stable and close to the expected value of `1/sqrt(dimensions) = 0.088`
for this run (`dimensions = 128`). If we had only monitored the loss, we would
not have noticed the representation collapse in the first run and continued
training, using up valuable time and compute resources.
