Tutorial 5: Custom Augmentations
==============================================

In this tutorial, we will train a model on chest X-ray images in a self-supervised manner.
In self-supervised learning, X-ray images can pose some problems: They are often more
than eight bits deep which makes them incompatible with certain standard torchvision
transforms such as, for example, random-resized cropping. Additionally, some augmentations
which are often used in self-supervised learning are ineffective on X-ray images.
For example, applying color jitter to an X-ray image with a single color channel
does not make sense.

We will show how to address these problems and how to train a ResNet-18 with MoCo
on a set of 16-bit X-ray images in TIFF format.

The original dataset this tutorial is based on can be found `on Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/overview>`_.
These images are in the DICOM format. For simplicity and efficiency reasons, 
we randomly selected ~4000 images from the above dataset, resized them such that the
maximum of the width and height of each image is no larger than 512, and converted
them to the 16-bit TIFF format. To do so, we used ImageMagick which is preinstalled
on most Linux systems.

# Setup custom data augmentations
# -------------------------------
#
# The key to working with 16-bit X-ray images is to convert them to 8-bit images
# which are compatible with the torchvision augmentations without creating harmful
# artifacts. A good way to do so, is to use histogram normalization as described in
# `this paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.04909.pdf>`_ about Covid-19 prognosis.
#
# Let's write an augmentation, which takes as input a numpy array with 16-bit input
# depth and returns a histogram normalized 8-bit PIL image.

# Gaussian noise instead. It's easiest to apply this after the image has been
# converted to a PyTorch tensor.

# learning, we need to create a lightly collate function like so:

# create a collate function which performs the random augmentations
collate_fn = lightly.data.BaseCollateFunction(transform)

# %%
# Setup dataset and dataloader
# ------------------------------
#
# We create a dataset which points to the images in the input directory. Since
# the input images are 16 bits deep, we need to overwrite the image loader such 
# that it doesn't convert the images to RGB (and hence to 8-bit) automatically.
#
# .. note:: The `LightlyDataset` uses a torchvision dataset underneath, which in turn uses
#   an image loader which transforms the input image to an 8-bit RGB image. If a 16-bit
#   grayscale image is loaded that way, all pixel values above 255 are simply clamped.
#   Therefore, we overwrite the default image loader with our custom one.

# the number of features matches the output dimension of the backbone.
model = lightly.models.MoCo(backbone, num_ftrs=512, m=0.99)

# %%
# Setup criterion and optimizer
# -----------------------------
# For the criterion, we use the NTXentLoss which should always be used with MoCo.
# MoCo also requires a memory bank - we set its size to 4096 which is approximately
# the size of the input dataset. The temperature parameter of the loss is set to 0.1.
# This smoothens the cross entropy term in the loss function.
#
# The choice of the optimizer is left to the user. Here, we go with simple stochastic
# gradient descent with momentum.

# %%
# Train MoCo with custom augmentations
# -------------------------------------
# Let's put all the puzzle pieces together and combine them in an encoder object.
# Training the self-supervised model is now very easy. Simply call the function
# `train_embedding` with the desired arguments.

# Evaluate the results
# ------------------------

# are. How to do this depends on the available data and metdata. Luckily, in our case,
# we have annotations of critical findings on the X-ray images. We can use this information
# to see, whether images with similar annotations are grouped together.
#
# We start by getting a vector representation of each image in the dataset. For this,
# we create a new dataloader. This time, we can pass the transform directly to the dataset.

# test transforms differ from training transforms as they do not introduce
# additional noise
