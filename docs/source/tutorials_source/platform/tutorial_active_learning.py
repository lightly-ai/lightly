Tutorial 3: Active learning with kNN
==============================================

We provide the tutorial in a ready to use 
`Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E3rz7fY7UqXNI_VYNxSu6KvQINzotwrz?usp=sharing>`_ 
notebook:


In this tutorial, we will run an active learning loop using both the lightly package and the platform.
An active learning loop is a sequence of multiple samplings each choosing only a subset
of all samples in the dataset.

To learn more about how active learning with lightly works have a look at :ref:`lightly-active-learning`.

This workflow has the following structure:

1. Choose an initial subset of your dataset e.g. using one of our samplers like the coreset sampler.
Split your dataset accordingly into a labeled set and unlabeled set. 

Next, the active learning loop starts:

2. Train a classifier on the labeled set.

3. Use the classifier to predict on the unlabeled set.

4. Calculate active learning scores from the prediction.

5. Use an active learning agent to choose the next samples to be labeled based on the scores.

6. Update the labeled set to include the newly chosen samples and remove them from the unlabeled set.

In this tutorial, we use a k-nearest-neighbor classifier that predicts the class of a sample
based on the class of the k nearest samples in the labeled set.
We use the euclidean distance between a sample's embeddings as the distance metric.
The advantage of such a classifier compared to CNNs is that it is very fast and easily implemented.

What you will learn
-------------------
* You learn how an active learning loop is set up and which components are needed for it.
* You learn how to perform active learning with Lightly.

Requirements
------------
- Make sure you are familiar with the command line tools described at :ref:`lightly-command-line-tool`.
- To make the definition of the dataset for training the classifier easy,
  we recommend using a dataset where the samples are grouped into folder according to their class.
  We use the clothing-dataset-small. You can download it using

.. code::

    git clone https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/clothing-dataset-small.git


Creation of the dataset on the Lightly Platform with embeddings
---------------------------------------------------------------

To perform samplings, we need to perform several steps, ideally with the CLI.
More documentation on each step can be found here: :ref:`lightly-command-line-tool`.

A. Train a model on the dataset, e.g. with

.. code::

    lightly-train input_dir="/datasets/clothing-dataset-small/train trainer.max_epochs=5

B. Create embeddings for the dataset, e.g. with

.. code::
    
    lightly-embed input_dir="/datasets/clothing-dataset-small/train" checkpoint=mycheckpoint.ckpt

Save the path to the embeddings.csv, you will need it later.
for uploading the embeddings and for defining the dataset for the classifier

C. Create a new dataset on the lightly platform as described in :ref:`lightly-platform`.
Save the token and dataset id, you will need them later to upload the images and embeddings
and to run the active learning samplers.

D. Upload the images to the platform, e.g. with

.. code::
    
    lightly-upload input_dir="/datasets/clothing-dataset-small/train" token="yourToken" dataset_id="yourDatasetId"
