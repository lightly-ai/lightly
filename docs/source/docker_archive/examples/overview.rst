.. warning::
    **The Docker Archive documentation is deprecated**

    The old workflow described in these docs will not be supported with new Lightly Worker versions above 2.6.
    Please switch to our `new documentation page <https://docs.lightly.ai>`_ instead.

We provide examples of how Lightly Docker can be used on various academic and 
wild datasets.
