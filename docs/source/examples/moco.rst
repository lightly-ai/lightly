This example can be run from the command line with::

    python lightly/examples/moco.py

.. literalinclude:: ../../../lightly/examples/moco.py

.. note::
    We adapted the parameters to make the example easily run on a machine with a single GPU.
    Please consult the paper if you want to follow the original training settings.
