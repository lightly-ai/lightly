Configuration
===================================

As the lightly framework the docker solution can be configured using Hydra.

The example below shows how the `token` parameter can be set when running the docker container.

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -it \
        -v {INPUT_DIR}:/home/input_dir:ro \
        -v {OUTPUT_DIR}:/home/shared_dir \
        --ipc="host" --network="host" \
        lightly/sampling:latest \
        token=MYAWESOMETOKEN

Note that `token` can optionally be passed as a `LIGHTLY_TOKEN` environment variable to keep it hidden from logs:

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -it \
        -e LIGHTLY_TOKEN=MYAWESOMETOKEN
        -v {INPUT_DIR}:/home/input_dir:ro \
        -v {OUTPUT_DIR}:/home/shared_dir \
        --ipc="host" --network="host" \
        lightly/sampling:latest

List of Parameters
-----------------------------------

The following are parameters which can be passed to the container:

.. code-block:: yaml

  # Access token, get it from app.lightly.ai.
  token: ''

  # If specified, the docker is registered as a worker on the Lightly platform.
  worker_id: ''

  # Set to True to check whether installation was successful.
  sanity_check: False 

  # Path to a file containing filenames to run the docker on a subset of the
  # files in the input directory. The docker will ignore all files in the input 
  # directory not listed here. Each filename must be on a separate line and 
  # relative to the input directory. The path relevant_filenames_file must be 
  # relative to the shared directory, so if the file is in 
  # 'shared_dir/directory/relevant_filenames.txt' the path should be set to
  # 'directory/relevant_filenames.txt'
  relevant_filenames_file: ''

  # Set to False to disable check for corrupted images.
  enable_corruptness_check: True
  corruptness_check:
    # Threshold in [0, 1] which determines the sensibility of the corruptness check
    # for video frames. Every frame which has an internally computed corruptness
    # score larger than the specified threshold will be classified as corrupted.
    corruption_threshold: 0.1

  # Remove exact duplicates.
  remove_exact_duplicates: True

  # Path to the checkpoint relative to the shared directory.
  checkpoint: ''

  # Dump the final dataset to the output directory.
  dump_dataset: False
  dump_sampled_embeddings: True
  # Set the size of the dumped images, use =x or =[height,width] to match the 
  # shortest edge to x or to resize the image to (height, width), use =-1 for no 
  # resizing (default). This only affects the output size of the images dumped to 
  # the output folder with dump_dataset=True. To change the size of images 
  # uploaded to the lightly platform or your cloud bucket please use the 
  # lightly.resize option instead.
  output_image_size: -1

  # Upload the dataset to the Lightly platform.
  upload_dataset: False

  # pretagging
  pretagging: False
  pretagging_debug: False
  pretagging_config: ''

  # Append weak labels.
  append_weak_labels: False

  # Normalize the embeddings to unit length.
  normalize_embeddings: True

  # active learning scorer
  scorer: 'object-frequency'
  scorer_config:
    frequency_penalty: 0.25
    min_score: 0.9


  # sampling

  stopping_condition:
    # Float in [0., 1.] for percentage, int for number of samples, -1 means inactive.
    n_samples: -1    
    # Float, minimum distance between two images in the sampled dataset, -1. means inactive.           
    min_distance: -1.
  selected_sequence_length: 1

  # datapool
  datapool:
    # Name of the datapool. This will create a local datapool.
    name:
    # If True keeps backup of all previous data pool states.
    keep_history: True
    # Dataset id from Lightly platform where the datapool should be hosted.
    dataset_id:

  # datasource
  # By default only new samples in the datasource are processed. Set process_all 
  # to True to reprocess all samples in the datasource.
  datasource:
    # Dataset id from the Lightly platform.
    dataset_id:
    # Set to True to reprocess all samples in the datasource.
    process_all: False
    # Update datapool with the selected samples.
    enable_datapool_update: True
    # Use video metadata to determine the number of frames in each video. Set to
    # True for faster processing. Set to False if you get video related errors.
    use_frame_count_metadata: False

  # Upload report to the Ligthly platform.
  upload_report: True
  # The number of retained/removed image pairs shown in the report.
  n_example_images: 6
  # Maximum size of the distance matrix allowed for report statistics in GB. 
  memory_requirement_in_GB: 2
  # Show timestamps of the selected frames for each video in the report. Set this
  # to False if you observe slow report generation or work with many videos (>20).
  show_video_sampling_timeline: True

  # optional deterministic unique output subdirectory for run, in place of timestamp
  run_directory:

Additionally, you can pass all arguments which can be passed to the lightly CLI tool with the `lightly` prefix.
For example,

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -it \
        -v {INPUT_DIR}:/home/input_dir:ro \
        -v {OUTPUT_DIR}:/home/output_dir \
        lightly/sampling:latest \
        token=MYAWESOMETOKEN \
        lightly.loader.batch_size=512

sets the batch size during training and embedding to 512. You find a list of all
lightly CLI parameters here: :ref:`ref-cli-config-default`

Choosing the Right Parameters
-----------------------------------

Below you find some distributions and the resulting histogram of the pairwise
distances. Typically, datasets consist of multiple normal or uniform 
distributions (second row). This makes sense. In autonomous driving, we collect
data in various cities, different weather conditions, or other factors. When 
working with video data from multiple cameras each camera might form a cluster
since images from the same static camera have lots of perceptual similarity.

The more interesting question is what kind of distribution you're aiming for.


**If we want to diversify the dataset** (e.g. create a really hard test set
covering all the special cases) we might want to aim for what looks like a grid.
The log histogram (yes, we plot the histograms in log scale!) for a grid pattern with
equal distance between two neighboring samples looks like a D.


**If you want to remove nearby duplicates** (e.g. reduce overfitting and bias)
we see good results when trying to sample using the *min_distance* stop condition.
E.g. set the *min_distance* to 0.1 to get rid of the small peak (if there is any)
close to 0 pairwise distance.

Increase I/O Performance
-----------------------------------
During the embedding process, the I/O bandwidth can often slow down the computation. A progress bar shows you the current compute 
efficiency which is calculated as the time spent on computation compared to overall time per batch. A number close to 1.0 tells you
that your system is well utilized. A number close to 0.0 however, suggests that there is an I/O bottleneck. This can be the case for
datasets consisting of very high-resolution images. Loading them from harddisk and preprocessing can take a lot of time.

To mitigate the effect of low I/O speed one can use background workers to load the data. First, we need to tell Docker to use
the host system for inter-process communication. Then, we can tell the filter to use multiple workers for data preprocessing.
You can use them by adding the following two parts to your docker run command:

* **-\-ipc="host"** sets the host for inter-process communication. 
  This flag needs to be set to use background workers. Since this is an argument 
  to the docker run command we add it before our filter arguments.

* **lightly.loader.num_workers=8** sets the number of background processes 
  to be used for data preprocessing. Usually, the number of physical 
  CPU cores works well.

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --rm -it \
        -v {INPUT_DIR}:/home/input_dir:ro \
        -v {OUTPUT_DIR}:/home/output_dir \
        --ipc=host \
        lightly/sampling:latest \
        token=MYAWESOMETOKEN \
        lightly.loader.num_workers=8
