First Steps
===================================

The Lightly worker follows a train, embed, select workflow:

.. code-block:: console

    +--------+      +---------+      +--------+
    | Train  +----->+  Embed  +----->+ Select |
    +--------+      +---------+      +--------+

#. You can either use a pre-trained model from the model zoo or fine-tune
   a model on your unlabeled dataset using self-supervised learning. The output
   of the train step is a model checkpoint.

#. The embed step creates embeddings of the input dataset. Each sample gets
   represented using a low-dimensional vector. The output of the embed step is
   a .csv file.

#. Finally, based on the embeddings and additional information, such as predictions or
   metdata, we can use  one of the selection strategies to pick the relevant data for you.
   The output of the selection is a list of selected input samples as well as analytics in form of a pdf report with plots.


The Lightly worker can easily be triggered from your Python code. There are various parameters you can configure and we put a lot of effort to also expose the full configuration of the lightly self-supervised learning framework.
You could use the Lightly worker to train a self-supervised model instead of using the Python framework.

Volume Mapping
--------------

Before we jump into the details of how to submit jobs, we need to start the Lightly image in
worker mode (as outlined in :ref:`ref-docker-setup`).

.. code-block:: console

    docker run --gpus all --rm -it \
        -v {OUTPUT_DIR}:/home/output_dir \
        lightly/worker:latest \
        token=MY_AWESOME_TOKEN \
        worker.worker_id=MY_WORKER_ID


Here, we use volume mapping provided by the docker run command to provide an output directory.
A docker container itself is not considered to be a good place to store data. 
Volume mapping allows the worker to interact with the filesystem of the host system.

The Lightly worker requires that an `{OUTPUT_DIR}` is specified where it can store
the results of all the computations. See `Reporting`_ and `Worker Output`_ for additional information.
The worker requires **read and write access** to this directory.

.. warning:: Docker volume or port mappings always follow the scheme that you first
          specify the host systems port followed by the internal port of the
          container. E.g. **-v /outputs:/home/outputs** would mount /outputs
          from your system to /home/outputs in the docker container.

.. note:: Learn how to obtain your :ref:`ref-authentication-token`.

Now, let's see how this will look in action!


.. _rst-worker-creating-a-dataset:

Creating a Dataset
------------------

For every job you want to submit, you require a `dataset_id` of a corresponding dataset in the Lightly API.
You can get the `dataset_id` either by creating a new dataset from Python or by re-using an existing dataset (see :ref:`ref-datapool`).


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Creating a new dataset from Python

    from lightly.api import ApiWorkflowClient
    from lightly.openapi_generated.swagger_client.models.dataset_type import DatasetType

    # Create the Lightly client to connect to the API.
    client = ApiWorkflowClient(token="MY_AWESOME_TOKEN")

    # Create a new dataset on the Lightly Platform.
    client.create_dataset(
        'dataset-name',
        DatasetType.IMAGES  # can be DatasetType.VIDEOS when working with videos
    )
    dataset_id = client.dataset_id


You can see the dataset under https://app.lightly.ai/datasets

Next, the dataset requires read and write access to your storage bucket. You can
re-use the `client` from the previous step. If you create a new `ApiWorkflowClient`
make sure to specify the `dataset_id` in the constructor.

    with configuring the different roles.


Scheduling a Simple Job
-----------------------

Now that everything is in place, let's configure and run a simple job

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Scheduling a job from Python

    client.schedule_compute_worker_run(
        worker_config={
            "enable_corruptness_check": True,
            "remove_exact_duplicates": True,
            "enable_training": False,
            "pretagging": False,
            "pretagging_debug": False,
            "method": "coreset",
            "stopping_condition": {
                "n_samples": 0.1,
                "min_distance": -1
            }
        }
    )


The command schedules a job with the following configurations:

- **enable_corruptness_check=True** Checks your dataset for corrupt images 

- **remove_exact_duplicates=True** Removes exact duplicates

- **stopping_condition.n_samples=0.1** Selects 10% of the images using the
  default method (coreset). Selecting 10% means that the remaining dataset
  will be 10% of the initial dataset size. You can also specify the exact 
  number of remaining images by setting **n_samples** to an integer.


The worker should pick up the job after a few seconds and start working on it. The
status of the current run and scheduled jobs can be seen under https://app.lightly.ai/compute/runs

After the job was processed, the selected data will be accessible in the configured dataset. The
report can be accessed from the compute worker runs page mentioned just above.


There's an alternative stopping condition to `n_samples`, the `min_distance`

- **stopping_condition.min_distance=0.2** would remove all samples which are
  closer to each other than 0.2. This allows you to specify the minimum allowed distance between two image 
  embeddings in the output dataset. After normalizing the input embeddings 
  to unit length, this value should be between 0 and 2. This is often a more 
  convenient method when working with different data sources and trying to 
  combine them in a balanced way.



Training a Self-Supervised Model
--------------------------------

Sometimes it may be beneficial to finetune a self-supervised model on your 
dataset before embedding the images. This may be the case when the dataset is 
from a specific domain (e.g. for medical images).

The command below will **train a self-supervised model** for (default: 100) 
epochs on the input images before embedding the images and selecting from them.


.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Scheduling a job with self-supervised training from Python

    client.schedule_compute_worker_run(
        worker_config={
            "enable_corruptness_check": True,
            "remove_exact_duplicates": True,
            "enable_training": True,
            "pretagging": False,
            "pretagging_debug": False,
            "method": "coreset",
            "stopping_condition": {
                "n_samples": 0.1,
                "min_distance": -1
            }
        }
    )

You may not always want to train for exactly 100 epochs with the default settings.
The Lightly worker is a wrapper around the lightly Python package.
Hence, for training and embedding the user can access all the settings from the lightly command-line tool.

                "n_samples": 0.1,
                "min_distance": -1
            }
        },

                'rr_prob': 0
            }
        }
    )


Specifying Relevant Files
-------------------------
Oftentimes not all files in a bucket are relevant. In that case, it's possible
to pass a list of filenames to the worker using the `relevant_filenames_file` configuration option.
It will then only consider the listed filenames and ignore all others. To do so, you can create a text file which
contains one relevant filename per line and then pass the path to the text file when scheduling the job. This works for videos and images.

.. warning:: The `relevant_filenames_file` is expected to be in the **output bucket** as specified above (see `Creating a Dataset`_). And must always be
    located in a subdirectory called `.lightly`.

For example, let's say you're working with the following file structure in an S3 bucket where
you are only interested in `image_1.png` and `subdir/image_3.png`

.. code-block:: console

    s3://my-input-bucket/
        L image_1.png
        L subdir/
            L image_2.png
            L image_3.png


Then you can add a file called `relevant_filenames.txt` to your output bucket with the following content

.. code-block:: text
    :caption: relevant_filenames.txt

    image_1.png
    subdir/image_3.png


The output bucket should then look like this:


.. code-block:: console

    s3://my-output-bucket/
        L .lightly/
            L relevant_filenames.txt


The corresponding Python command to submit a job would then be as follows:

.. code-block:: python
    :caption: Scheduling a job with relevant filenames from Python

    client.schedule_compute_worker_run(
        worker_config={
            "relevant_filenames_file": ".lightly/relevant_filenames.txt",
            "enable_corruptness_check": True,
            "remove_exact_duplicates": True,
            "enable_training": False,
            "pretagging": False,
            "pretagging_debug": False,
            "method": "coreset",
            "stopping_condition": {
                "n_samples": 0.1,
                "min_distance": -1
            }
        }
    )


Reporting
---------

To facilitate sustainability and reproducibility in ML, the Lightly worker
has an integrated reporting component. For every dataset, you run through the container
an output directory gets created with the exact configuration used for the experiment. 
Additionally, plots, statistics, and more information collected
during the various processing steps are provided.
E.g. there is information about the corruptness check, embedding process and selection process.

To make it easier for you to understand and discuss the dataset we put the essential information into
an automatically generated PDF report.
Sample reports can be found on the `Lightly website <https://lightly.ai/analytics>`_.


Worker Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The output directory is structured in the following way:

* config:
   A directory containing copies of the configuration files and overwrites.
* data:
   The data directory contains everything to do with data. 
   
    * If `enable_corruptness_check=True`, it will contain a "clean" version of the dataset. 
    * If `remove_exact_duplicates=True`, it will contain a copy of the `embeddings.csv` 
        where all duplicates are removed. Otherwise, it will 
        simply store the embeddings computed by the model.
   
* filenames:
   This directory contains lists of filenames of the corrupt images, removed images, selected
   images and the images which were removed because they have an exact duplicate in the dataset.
* plots:
   A directory containing the plots which were produced for the report.
* report.pdf
   To provide a simple overview of the filtering process the Lightly worker automatically generates a report.
   The report contains

   * information about the job (duration, processed files etc.)
   * estimated savings in terms of labeling costs and CO2 due to the smaller dataset
   * statistics about the dataset before and after the selection process
   * histogram before and after filtering
   * visualizations of the dataset
   * nearest neighbors of retained images among the removed ones

* The report is also available as a report.json file. Any value from the pdf report can be easily be accessed.

Evaluation of the Selection Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Histograms and Plots**

The report contains histograms of the pairwise distance between images before and after the selection process.

An example of such a histogram before and after filtering for the CamVid dataset consisting of 367
samples is shown below. We marked the region which is of special interest with an orange rectangle. 
Our goal is to make this histogram more symmetric by removing samples of short distances from each other. 

If we remove 25 samples (7%) out of the 367 samples of the CamVid dataset the histogram looks more symmetric
as shown below. In our experiments, removing 7% of the dataset results in a model with higher validation set accuracy.

.. image:: images/histogram_before_after.jpg

.. note::

    Why symmetric histograms are preferred: An asymmetric histogram can be the result of either a dataset with outliers or inliers.
    A heavy tail for low distances means that there is at least one high-density region with many samples very close to each other within the main cluster.
    Having such a high-density region can lead to biased models trained on this particular dataset. A heavy tail towards high distances shows that there is
    at least one high-density region outside the main cluster of samples.


Manually Inspecting the Embeddings
----------------------------------
Every time you run Lightly worker you will find an `embeddings.csv` file in the
output directory. This file contains the embeddings of all samples in your dataset.
You can use the embeddings for clustering or manual inspection of your dataset.

.. figure:: images/colab_embeddings_example.png

We provide an 
`example notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aHJBKyfopheWYOkIEEXyxyRoqQVfWe3A?usp=sharing>`_
to learn more about how to work with the embeddings.
