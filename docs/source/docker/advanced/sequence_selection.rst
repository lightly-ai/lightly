Sequence Selection
==================

Sequence selection allows users to select sequences of a video instead of single frames.
The key concept is the parameter `selected_sequence_length`. If its value is one (default),
the docker selects single frames. If it is larger than one, each video is split into 
sequences of that length and the frame representations are aggregated into a sequence
representation. The selection then happens on these sequence representations.

.. note:: Sequence selection works on videos or on folders of alphabetically sorted
    frames.


How It Works
-------------
Sequence selection consists of the following steps:

1. Each input video is split into sequences of length `selected_sequence_length`.
2. Next, the embeddings of all frames in a sequence are aggregated (averaged).
3. The selection is performed on sequence level.
4. Finally, the indices of the selected sequence frames are reconstructed.
5. Information about the selected sequences is saved in the output directory.
6. The report is generated and (if requested) the selected frames are saved.


Usage
-----------

To select sequences of length **X** simply add the argument **selected_sequence_length=X**
to your Lightly Worker run command. Hereby, **X** must be an integer number which evenly divides
the **stopping_condition.n_samples**. If **stopping_condition.n_samples** is a fraction,
the Lightly Worker will automatically round it to the next multiple of of **X**.


For example, let's say we have a folder with two videos
which we randomly downloaded from `Pexels <https://www.pexels.com/>`_: 

.. code-block:: console

    ls /datasets/pexels/
    > Pexels_Videos_1409899.mp4  Pexels_Videos_2495382.mp4

Now, we want to select sequences of length ten. We can use the following script:

.. literalinclude:: code_examples/python_run_sequence_selection.py

The above script will create a run to select 20 sequences each consisting of ten frames. The selected
frames are then saved in the output directory for further processing. Note that Lightly Worker 
currently doesn't support the corruptness check and removing exact duplicates for
sequence selection. Hence we have to deactivate them in the command above.

To make sure our run gets processed we need to make sure we have a Lightly Worker
running:

.. code-block:: console

  docker run--shm-size="1024m" --rm --gpus all -it \
    -v /docker-output:/home/output_dir lightly/worker:latest \
    token=YOUR_TOKEN  worker.worker_id=YOUR_WORKER_ID

.. warning:: The stopping condition `n_samples` must be equal to to the number of
    desired sequences times the `selected_sequence_length`, i.e. **n_samples = n_sequences x selected_sequence_length**.
    In the example above 20 sequences times ten frames is exactly 200.


In our example, a look at a PCA of the embeddings of the selected frames nicely shows
the 20 selected sequences. The following image is taken from the output of the 
Lightly Worker:

    :align: center
    :alt: PCA of embeddings of frames
    :figwidth: 80%

    input videos (yellow and purple).


Sequence Selection Information
------------------------------

The Lightly Worker will create a file at `{docker-output}/data/sequence_information.json`
containing detailed information about the selected sequences. The file can be used
for further analysis of your dataset based on sequences.

The file contains a list of sequence dictionaries. Every dicionary lists the
exact contents for one sequence. In the case of video frame sequences the
`sequence_information.json` will look similar to the example shown below:

.. code:: json

    [
        {
            "video_name": "Pexels_Videos_1409899.mp4",
            "frame_names": [
                "Pexels_Videos_1409899-40-mp4.png",

                ...
            ],
            "frame_timestamps_pts": [
                359726680,
                368719847,
                377713014,
                ...
            ],
            "frame_timestamps_sec": [
                4.886145,
                5.008298625,
                5.13045225,
                ...
            ],
            "frame_indices": [
                40,
                41,
                42,
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "video_name": "Pexels_Videos_1409899.mp4",
            "frame_names": [
                "Pexels_Videos_1409899-100-mp4.png",
                "Pexels_Videos_1409899-101-mp4.png",
                "Pexels_Videos_1409899-102-mp4.png",
                ...
            ],
            "frame_timestamps_pts": [
                422678849,
                431672016,
                440665183,
                ...
            ],
            "frame_timestamps_sec": [
                6.095856060606061,

                6.339690303030303,

            "frame_indices": [
                100,

                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]


For image file sequences it only lists the filenames for every sequence:

.. code:: json

    [
        {
            "filenames": [
                "image_40.png",
                "image_41.png",
                "image_42.png",
                ...
            ] 
        },
        {
            "filenames": [
                "image_100.png",
                "image_101.png",
                "image_102.png",
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]


Cropping Sequences From Videos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the timestamps stored in the `sequence_information.json` file, the selected
video sequences can be cropped from the original videos. Make sure that 
`ffmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`_ is available on your system for cropping the videos.

There are two types of stored timestamps:

* `frame_timestamps_pts`: Presentation timestamps in timebase units of the video.
* `frame_timestamps_sec`: Presentation timestamps in seconds.

To crop a sequence, the first and last timestamp from the `frame_timestamps_pts`
list and the `video_name` stored in the `sequence_information.json` file are 
required. The cropping can be done with the following command using an
`ffmpeg trim filter <https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#trim>`_:

.. code:: console

    ffmpeg -i {VIDEO_NAME} -copyts -filter "trim=start_pts={FIRST_TIMESTAMP_PTS}:end_pts={LAST_TIMESTAMP_PTS + 1}" {SEQUENCE_NAME}

    # example using the videos from above
    ffmpeg -i Pexels_Videos_1409899.mp4 -copyts -filter "trim=start_pts=359726680:end_pts=377713015" sequence_1.mp4

.. warning::

    Make sure that `end_pts` is set to `LAST_TIMESTAMP + 1` otherwise the last
    frame in the sequence will not be included in the cropped video!

Sequences can also be cropped using the first and last timestamp from the `frame_timestamps_sec`
list. However, depending on the video and sequence, this can result in the last frame
of the sequence not being included in the cropped video. We recommend to use
`frame_timestamps_pts` if possible. The following command can be used for cropping using
`frame_timestamps_sec`:

.. code:: console

    ffmpeg -i {VIDEO_NAME} -copyts -filter "trim=start={FIRST_TIMESTAMP_SEC}:end={LAST_TIMESTAMP_SEC}" {SEQUENCE_NAME}

    # example using the videos from above
    ffmpeg -i Pexels_Videos_1409899.mp4 -copyts -filter "trim=start=4.886145:end=5.985527625" sequence_1.mp4
