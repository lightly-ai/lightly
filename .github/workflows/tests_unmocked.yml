name: run unmocked tests
on: [workflow_dispatch]

# Why is this only triggered manually with workflow_dispatch?
# - We have many unittests anyway
# - We ran into quota problems with too many tests (3000mins for the pip package)
# - The tests are unreliable / not deterministic, as they depend on the API from staging
# - The tests take 10mins, which can slow down development
